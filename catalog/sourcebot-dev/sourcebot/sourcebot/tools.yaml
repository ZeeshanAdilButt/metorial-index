    description: >-
      Fetches code that matches the provided regex pattern in `query`. This is
      NOT a semantic search.
          Results are returned as an array of matching files, with the file's URL, repository, and language.
          If the `includeCodeSnippets` property is true, code snippets containing the matches will be included in the response. Only set this to true if the request requires code snippets (e.g., show me examples where library X is used).
          When referencing a file in your response, **ALWAYS** include the file's external URL as a link. This makes it easier for the user to view the file, even if they don't have it locally checked out.
          **ONLY USE** the `filterByRepoIds` property if the request requires searching a specific repo(s). Otherwise, leave it empty.

            \        1. When a regex special character needs to be escaped,
            ALWAYS use a single backslash () (e.g., 'console.log')

            \        2. **ALWAYS** escape spaces with a single backslash ()
            (e.g., 'console log')
