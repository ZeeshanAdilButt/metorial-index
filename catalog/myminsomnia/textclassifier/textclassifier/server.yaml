  description: Provide multiple common text classification models based on CNN,
    RNN, and pre-trained NLP models to perform sentiment analysis and other text
    classification tasks. Enable users to preprocess data, train word
    embeddings, and apply advanced models like Bi-LSTM, Transformer, ELMo, and
    BERT for accurate text classification. Facilitate easy experimentation with
    various architectures and improve classification performance with attention
    mechanisms and adversarial training.
