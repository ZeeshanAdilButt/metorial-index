  description: Introduce deliberate pauses in your workflows to ensure
    time-dependent operations complete successfully. Use the `wait` tool to
    instruct your MCP client to pause for a specified duration, preventing
    premature execution of subsequent steps. Perfect for web automation, command
    line operations, and API interactions.
