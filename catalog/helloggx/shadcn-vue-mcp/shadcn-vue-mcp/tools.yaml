            exactly which components (buttons, forms, modals, etc.) the user is
            referring to and what aspects (styling, layout, responsiveness,
            etc.) they want to enhance. Do not include generic improvements -
            focus only on what the user explicitly mentions or what can be
            reasonably inferred from the available context. If nothing specific
            is mentioned or you cannot determine what needs improvement, return
            an empty string.
