  description: The Unraid MCP Server is a Python-based bridge that enables AI
    assistants to interact with Unraid servers through natural language. Using
    the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with stdio transport, it provides
    comprehensive management capabilities including system monitoring, array
    operations, Docker container management, VM control, disk operations, user
    administration, API key management, remote access configuration,
    notification handling, and share management. This integration allows users
    to query system status, manage resources, and perform administrative tasks
    through conversational AI, eliminating the need for command-line expertise
    while maintaining robust error handling, timeout management, and detailed
    logging for reliable server management.
