  description: Give your coding agent access to your Figma design data to
    implement designs in any framework in one shot. Enhance AI-powered coding
    tools like Cursor by providing them with simplified and relevant Figma
    metadata for more accurate and context-aware code generation. Streamline
    your design-to-code workflow by integrating Figma files directly into your
    development environment.
