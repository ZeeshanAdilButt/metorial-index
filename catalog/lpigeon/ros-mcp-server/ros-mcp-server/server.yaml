  description: The ROS MCP Server is designed to support robots in performing
    complex tasks and adapting effectively to various environments by providing
    a set of functions that transform natural language commands, entered by a
    user through an LLM, into ROS commands for robot control. Furthermore, by
    utilizing rosbridge, it is configured to operate with both ROS and ROS2
    systems, and its WebSocket-based communication enables broad applicability
    across diverse platforms.
