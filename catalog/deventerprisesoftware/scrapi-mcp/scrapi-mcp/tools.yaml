    description: Use a URL to scrape a website using the ScrAPI service and retrieve
      the result as HTML. Use this for scraping website content that is
      difficult to access because of bot detection, captchas or even geolocation
      restrictions. The result will be in HTML which is preferable if advanced
      parsing is required.
