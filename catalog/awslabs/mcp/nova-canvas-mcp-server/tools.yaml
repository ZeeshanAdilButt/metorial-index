    description: "Generate an image using Amazon Nova Canvas with text prompt.


      \    This tool uses Amazon Nova Canvas to generate images based on a text
      prompt.

      \    The generated image will be saved to a file and the path will be
      returned.


      \    IMPORTANT FOR ASSISTANT: Always send the current workspace directory
      when calling this tool!

      \    The workspace_dir parameter should be set to the directory where the
      user is currently working

      \    so that images are saved to a location accessible to the user.


      \    ## Prompt Best Practices


      \    An effective prompt often includes short descriptions of:

      \    1. The subject

      \    2. The environment

      \    3. (optional) The position or pose of the subject

      \    4. (optional) Lighting description

      \    5. (optional) Camera position/framing

      \    6. (optional) The visual style or medium (\"photo\",
      \"illustration\", \"painting\", etc.)


      \    Do not use negation words like \"no\", \"not\", \"without\" in your
      prompt. Instead, use the

      \    negative_prompt parameter to specify what you don't want in the
      image.


      \    You should always include \"people, anatomy, hands, low quality, low
      resolution, low detail\" in your negative_prompt


      \    ## Example Prompts


      \    - \"realistic editorial photo of female teacher standing at a
      blackboard with a warm smile\"

      \    - \"whimsical and ethereal soft-shaded story illustration: A woman in
      a large hat stands at the ship's railing looking out across the ocean\"

      \    - \"drone view of a dark river winding through a stark Iceland
      landscape, cinematic quality\"


      \    Returns:

      \        McpImageGenerationResponse: A response containing the generated
      image paths.
