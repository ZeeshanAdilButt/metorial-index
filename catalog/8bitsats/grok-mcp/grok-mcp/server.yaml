    MCP server that allows you to generate images using Grok's AI image
    generation capabilities. The server is configured with a xAI API key and is
    now available for use.


    How to Use Image Generation

    You can now ask me to generate images with commands like:


    "Generate an image of a cat sitting on a mountain"

    "Create an illustration of a futuristic city"

    "Make a picture of an astronaut riding a horse"

    "Show me what a dragon in a library would look like"

    The MCP server supports generating multiple images (up to 10) and can return
    either URLs or base64-encoded images.


    Behind the scenes, the server:


    Takes your text prompt

    Sends it to the Grok AI image generation API (grok-2-image model)

    Returns the generated image(s) with their URLs or base64 data

    Also provides the revised prompt that was used for generation

    The implementation is complete and ready to use immediately!
