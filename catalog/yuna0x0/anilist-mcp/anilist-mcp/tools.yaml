            Query term is used for searching with specific word or title in
            mind.


            You SHOULD not include things that can be found in the filter
            object, such as genre or tag.

            Those things should be included in the filter object instead.


            To check whether a user requested term should be considered as a
            query term or a filter term.

            It is recommended to use tools like 'get_genres' and
            'get_media_tags' first.

            the site default: "{ "sort": ["SEARCH_MATCH"] }".

            You SHOULD not include things that can be found in the filter

            Those things should be included in the filter object instead.


            To check whether a user requested term should be considered as a

            It is recommended to use tools like 'get_genres' and
            'get_media_tags' first.

            Filter object for searching manga.

            You MUST NOT include "{ "type": "MANGA" }" in the filter object. As
            it is already included in the API call.

            When no sorting method or any filter is specified, you SHOULD use
            the site default: "{ "sort": ["SEARCH_MATCH"] }".

            Otherwise, request is likely to fail or return no results.
