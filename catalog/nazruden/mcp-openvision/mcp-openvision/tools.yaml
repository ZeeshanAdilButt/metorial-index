      \    Analyze an image using OpenRouter's vision capabilities.


      \    This tool allows you to send an image to OpenRouter's vision models
      for analysis.

      \    You provide a query to guide the analysis and can optionally
      customize the system prompt

      \    for more control over the model's behavior.


      \    Args:

      \        image: The image as a base64-encoded string, URL, or local file
      path

      \        query: Text prompt to guide the image analysis. For best results,
      provide context

      \               about why you're analyzing the image and what specific
      information you need.

      \               Including details about your purpose and required focus
      areas leads to more

      \               relevant and useful responses.

      \        system_prompt: Instructions for the model defining its role and
      behavior

      \        model: The vision model to use (defaults to the value set by
      OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL)

      \        max_tokens: Maximum number of tokens in the response (100-4000)

      \        temperature: Temperature parameter for generation (0.0-1.0)

      \        top_p: Optional nucleus sampling parameter (0.0-1.0)

      \        presence_penalty: Optional penalty for new tokens based on
      presence in text so far (0.0-2.0)

      \        frequency_penalty: Optional penalty for new tokens based on
      frequency in text so far (0.0-2.0)

      \        project_root: Optional root directory to resolve relative image
      paths against


      \    Returns:

      \        The analysis result as text


      \    Examples:

      \        Basic usage with a file path:

      \            image_analysis(image=\"path/to/image.jpg\", query=\"Describe
      this image in detail\")


      \        Basic usage with an image URL:

      \            image_analysis(image=\"https://example.com/image.jpg\",
      query=\"Describe this image in detail\")


      \        Basic usage with a relative path and project root:

      \            image_analysis(image=\"examples/image.jpg\",
      project_root=\"/path/to/project\", query=\"Describe this image in
      detail\")


      \        Usage with a detailed contextual query:

      \            image_analysis(

      \                image=\"path/to/image.jpg\",

      \                query=\"Analyze this product packaging design for a
      fitness supplement. Identify all nutritional claims,

      \                      certifications, and health icons. Assess the visual
      hierarchy and how the key selling points

      \                      are communicated. This is for a competitive
      analysis project.\"

      \            )


      \        Usage with custom system prompt:

      \            image_analysis(

      \                image=\"path/to/image.jpg\",

      \                query=\"What objects can you see in this image?\",

      \                system_prompt=\"You are an expert at identifying objects
      in images. Focus on listing all visible objects.\"

            Your purpose is to provide accurate, comprehensive descriptions of
            images that help AI agents understand visual content they cannot
            directly perceive. Focus on describing all relevant elements in the
            image - objects, people, text, colors, spatial relationships,
            actions, and context. Be precise but concise, organizing information
            from most to least important. Avoid making assumptions beyond what's
            visible and clearly indicate any uncertainty. When text appears in
            images, transcribe it verbatim within quotes. Respond only with
            factual descriptions without subjective judgments or creative
            embellishments. Your descriptions should enable an agent to make
            informed decisions based solely on your analysis.
