  description: >-
    Allow LLMs to access, process, and act on real-time blockchain data from
    multiple blockchain networks. Instead of handling complex node RPCs, raw
    event logs, or chain-specific data structures, developers can access
    normalized, multi-chain blockchain data in a format optimized for AI
    reasoning and decision-making.


    With Nodit's MCP, you can:


    • Enable your LLM to query, analyze, and interact with real-time blockchain
    data across both EVM-compatible and non-EVM networks.


    • Create Web3-integrated applications without requiring specialized
    blockchain development expertise.


    • Leverage Nodit's reliable RPC node infrastructure, Web3 Data APIs, and
    GraphQL indexer APIs through a unified access layer.


    Supported networks include Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon,
    Aptos, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, TRON, XRPL, and more.
