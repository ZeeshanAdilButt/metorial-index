  description: Expose your GraphQL backend operations as callable tools for AI
    models, enabling seamless integration of GraphQL queries and mutations with
    AI assistants. Automatically generate an MCP server from your GraphQL schema
    and operations, allowing AI to invoke these tools with or without arguments.
    Simplify building AI-powered applications by turning your GraphQL API into a
    model-ready tool layer without extra infrastructure.
