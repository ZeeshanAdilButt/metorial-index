      \    Automatically triggers when the user asks about buying, browsing,
      comparing, or finding any type of product,

      \    such as electronics, clothing, books, appliances, etc.

      query.

      \    Returns a structured JSON response including product listings
      formatted for Markdown.


      \    The expected format for LLM presentation is a Markdown list of the
      top results:

      \    - Each item must always include the product title as a clickable
      Markdown link.

      \    - The link must always point to a valid product URL.

      \    - Each product listing should include the price after the link.

      \    - Only the most relevant results (e.g., top 25) should be shown.


      \    Example output:

      \    Here are some results:


      \    - [Product Title 1](https://example.com/product1) - $19.99

      \    - [Product Title 2](https://example.com/product2) - $24.99
