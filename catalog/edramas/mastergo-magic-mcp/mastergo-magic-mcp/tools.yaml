      "Use this tool to retrieve the DSL (Domain Specific Language) data from
      MasterGo design files and the rules you must follow when generating code.

      This tool is useful when you need to analyze the structure of a design,
      understand component hierarchy, or extract design properties.

      You must provide a fileId and layerId to identify the specific design
      element.

      This tool returns the raw DSL data in JSON format that you can then parse
      and analyze.

      This tool also returns the rules you must follow when generating code.

      The DSL data can also be used to transform and generate code for different
      frameworks."

    description: When the data returned by mcp__getDsl contains a non-empty
      componentDocumentLinks array, this tool is used to sequentially retrieve
      URLs from the componentDocumentLinks array and then obtain component
      documentation data. The returned document data is used for you to generate
      frontend code based on components.
