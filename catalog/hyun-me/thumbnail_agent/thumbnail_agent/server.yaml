  description: >-
    A modular agent that generates clean, optimized product thumbnails from raw
    image URLs.


    1. Background Removal: Automatically removes backgrounds using advanced AI
    segmentation.

    2. Thumbnail Optimization: Adds a white background, resizes to 1000Ã—1000px,
    and compresses for web use.

    3. Product-Linked Output: Saves the generated thumbnail with the associated
    product_id and updates the database.

    4. MCP-Ready: Designed to run inside MCP workflows, easily integrated into
    multi-step product content pipelines.

    5. Secure Configuration: Connects to MySQL using environment variables to
    avoid hardcoded credentials.
