description: Enables AI assistants to control robots through ROS 2 topics using
  natural language commands, executing movement as timed velocity commands on
  robots. It processes commands and publishes `geometry_msgs/Twist` messages to
  manage robot movements efficiently in both simulation and real environments.
skills:
  - Control robots via natural language commands
  - Execute timed velocity commands
  - Publish ROS 2 messages to `/cmd_vel`
  - Handle commands from MCP clients using FastMCP
  - Support duration-based movement commands
