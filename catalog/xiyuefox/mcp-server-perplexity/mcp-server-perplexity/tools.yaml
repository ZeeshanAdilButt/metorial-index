      Perplexity equips agents with a specialized tool for efficiently
      gathering source-backed information from the internet, ideal for
      scenarios requiring research, fact-checking, or contextual data to
      inform decisions and responses.
      Each response includes citations, which provide transparent references
      to the sources used for the generated answer, and choices, which
      contain the model's suggested responses, enabling users to access
      reliable information and diverse perspectives.
      This function may encounter timeout errors due to long processing times,
      but retrying the operation can lead to successful completion.
      [Response structure]
      - id: An ID generated uniquely for each response.
      - model: The model used to generate the response.
      - object: The object type, which always equals `chat.completion`.
      - created: The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was
        created.
      - citations[]: Citations for the generated answer.
      - choices[]: The list of completion choices the model generated for the
        input prompt.
      - usage: Usage statistics for the completion request.
