  - name: find_typescript_definition
    description: Use /ts-def to trigger this tool. This tool can find the definition
      of a TypeScript symbol in your codebase. When you encounter an imported
      symbol (e.g., 'import { StdioServerTransport } from
      "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js"'), this tool will locate its
      original definition file and code. Simply provide the current file path,
      the line content and the symbol's column number, and it will return the
      source definition location and code snippet.
    inputSchema:
      type: object
      required:
        - file_path
        - line_content
        - column_number
      properties:
        file_path:
          type: string
          description: The absolute path to the current typescript file (e.g.,
            '/remote/.../src/index.ts')
        line_content:
          type: string
          description: Pass the entire line of the symbol you want to find the definition
            of. The line content will be used to find the line number in the
            file instead of directly passing line number which AI Editor often
            has trouble with. The first line matching the content will be used.
        column_number:
          type: number
          description: The column number of the symbol (1-based indexing). For instance,
            you want to find the definition of StdioServerTransport, and the
            column number of symbol 'StdioServerTransport' in line 'import {
            StdioServerTransport } from
            "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js"' is 12, you should pass
            12 as the column_number.
