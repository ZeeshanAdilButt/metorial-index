      Resolves a package name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns a
      list of matching libraries.


      You MUST call this function before 'get-library-docs' to obtain a valid
      Context7-compatible library ID.


      When selecting the best match, consider:

      - Name similarity to the query

      - Description relevance

      - Code Snippet count (documentation coverage)

      - GitHub Stars (popularity)


      Return the selected library ID and explain your choice. If there are
      multiple good matches, mention this but proceed with the most relevant
      one.
