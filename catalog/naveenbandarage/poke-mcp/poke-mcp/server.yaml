  description: Poke-MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides
    Pokémon information through a standardized interface. It connects to the
    [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data and exposes it through
    MCP tools that can be used by any MCP-compatible client, such as Claude
    Desktop App, Continue, Cline, and others.
