      Allows you to modify the content relative to a heading, block reference,
      or frontmatter field in your document.


      Examples

      All of the below examples assume you have a document that looks like this:


      ---

      alpha: 1

      beta: test

      delta:

      zeta: 1

      yotta: 1

      gamma:

      - one

      - two

      ---


      # Heading 1


      This is the content for heading one


      Also references some [[#^484ef2]]


      ## Subheading 1:1

      Content for Subheading 1:1


      ### Subsubheading 1:1:1


      ### Subsubheading 1:1:2


      Testing how block references work for a table.[[#^2c7cfa]]

      Some content for Subsubheading 1:1:2


      More random text.


      ^2d9b4a


      ## Subheading 1:2


      Content for Subheading 1:2.


      some content with a block reference ^484ef2


      ## Subheading 1:3

      | City         | Population |

      | ------------ | ---------- |

      | Seattle, WA  | 8          |

      | Portland, OR | 4          |

      Append Content Below a Heading

      If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below "Subheading 1:1:1" under
      "Heading 1", you could send a request with the following headers:


      Operation: append

      Target-Type: heading

      Target: Heading 1::Subheading 1:1:1

      with the request body: Hello

      The above would work just fine for prepend or replace, too, of course, but
      with different results.


      Append Content to a Block Reference

      If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below the block referenced by
      "2d9b4a" above ("More random text."), you could send the following
      headers:


      Operation: append

      Target-Type: block

      Target: 2d9b4a

      with the request body: Hello

      The above would work just fine for prepend or replace, too, of course, but
      with different results.


      Add a Row to a Table Referenced by a Block Reference

      If you wanted to add a new city ("Chicago, IL") and population ("16") pair
      to the table above referenced by the block reference 2c7cfa, you could
      send the following headers:


      Operation: append

      TargetType: block

      Target: 2c7cfa

      Content-Type: application/json

      with the request body: [["Chicago, IL", "16"]]

      The use of a Content-Type of application/json allows the API to infer that
      member of your array represents rows and columns of your to append to the
      referenced table. You can of course just use a Content-Type of
      text/markdown, but in such a case you'll have to format your table row
      manually instead of letting the library figure it out for you.


      You also have the option of using prepend (in which case, your new row
      would be the first -- right below the table heading) or replace (in which
      case all rows except the table heading would be replaced by the new row(s)
      you supplied).


      Setting a Frontmatter Field

      If you wanted to set the frontmatter field alpha to 2, you could send the
      following headers:


      Operation: replace

      TargetType: frontmatter

      Target: beep

      with the request body 2

      If you're setting a frontmatter field that might not already exist you may
      want to use the Create-Target-If-Missing header so the new frontmatter
      field is created and set to your specified value if it doesn't already
      exist.
