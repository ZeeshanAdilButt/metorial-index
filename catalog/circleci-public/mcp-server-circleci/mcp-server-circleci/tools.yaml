      \    This tool helps debug CircleCI build failures by retrieving failure
      logs.


      \    Input options (EXACTLY ONE of these two options must be used):


      \    Option 1 - Direct URL (provide ONE of these):

      \    - failedJobURL: The URL of the failed CircleCI job (must be provided
      by the user)

      \    - failedPipelineURL: The URL of the failed CircleCI pipeline (must be
      provided by the user)


      \    Option 2 - Project Detection (ALL of these must be provided
      together):

      \    - workspaceRoot: The absolute path to the workspace root

      \    - gitRemoteURL: The URL of the git remote repository

      \    - branch: The name of the current branch


      \    IMPORTANT:

      \    - Never call this tool with incomplete parameters

      \    - If using Option 1, the URLs MUST be provided by the user - do not
      attempt to construct or guess URLs

      \    - If using Option 2, ALL THREE parameters (workspaceRoot,
      gitRemoteURL, branch) must be provided

      \    - If neither option can be fully satisfied, ask the user for the
      missing information before making the tool call
