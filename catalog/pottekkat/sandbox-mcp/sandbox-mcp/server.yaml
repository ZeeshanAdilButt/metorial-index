  description: Enable LLMs to run code safely in secure, isolated Docker
    containers, preventing unintended consequences from untested code execution.
    Provide an easy-to-use, configurable execution environment that helps
    generate more accurate code with fewer iterations. Empower LLMs with safe
    code testing capabilities locally through a simple MCP server.
