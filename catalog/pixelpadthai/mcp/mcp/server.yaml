  description: Provide a flexible and extensible server implementation of the
    Model Context Protocol to enable LLM applications to access external data,
    tools, and prompt templates dynamically. Facilitate seamless integration of
    language models with real-world resources and actions through a standardized
    JSON-RPC interface. Enhance LLM capabilities by allowing them to invoke
    tools, read resources, and use reusable prompts efficiently.
