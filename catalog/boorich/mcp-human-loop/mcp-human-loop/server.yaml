  description: Manage human-agent collaboration efficiently by determining when
    human intervention is necessary in AI operations. Utilize a sequential
    scoring system to evaluate requests across multiple dimensions, ensuring
    that only truly complex or sensitive cases reach human operators. Enhance
    decision-making transparency and system learning through tracked outcomes
    and adjustable thresholds.
