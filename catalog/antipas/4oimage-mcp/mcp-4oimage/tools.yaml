      Generate images using the 4o-image API and automatically open the results
      in your browser.


      This tool generates images based on your prompt and automatically opens
      them in your default browser, while also returning a clickable link.


      The tool supports two modes:

      1. Text-to-image - Create new images using just a text prompt

      2. Image editing - Provide a base image and prompt for editing or style
      transfer


      The response will include a direct link to the generated image and
      detailed information.
