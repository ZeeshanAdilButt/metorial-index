    http://cloudwewrx.dev


    A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenAI's gpt-image-1 model that
    enables AI assistants to generate and edit images from text prompts.
    Seamlessly integrates with MCP clients like VS Code, Roo, Cursor, Augment,
    and Windsurf through simple configuration.


    Generate stunning images with the create_image tool by providing text
    descriptions, or transform existing images with create_image_edit by
    specifying areas to modify using masks. The image editing workflow supports
    both base64-encoded images and direct file paths, making it flexible for
    various use cases.


    Features include beautifully formatted responses with emojis, automatic
    image saving to configurable directories, comprehensive error handling with
    detailed diagnostics, and detailed token usage reporting. All generated
    images are saved locally with timestamped filenames for easy reference and
    organization.
