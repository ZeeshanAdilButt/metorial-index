      Performs a comprehensive web search using Tavily's AI-powered search
      engine. 
                      Excels at extracting and summarizing relevant content from web pages, making it ideal for research, 
                      fact-finding, and gathering detailed information. Can run in either 'basic' mode for faster, simpler searches 
                      or 'advanced' mode for more thorough analysis. Basic is cheaper and good for most use cases. 
                      Supports filtering results by including or excluding specific domains.
                      Use include_domains/exclude_domains parameters to filter by specific websites.
                      Returns multiple search results with AI-extracted relevant content.
