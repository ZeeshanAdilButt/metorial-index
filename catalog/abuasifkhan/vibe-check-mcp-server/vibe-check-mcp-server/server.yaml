  description: Add a metacognitive oversight layer to your AI agents to prevent
    cascading errors and overengineering in coding workflows. Use strategic
    pattern interrupts and feedback loops to help agents reconsider and simplify
    their plans, improving alignment and reducing tunnel vision. Enhance your
    AI's reasoning with tools designed to stop and recalibrate complex tasks
    before they escalate.
