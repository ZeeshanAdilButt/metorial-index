    description: Use this tool when you need to analyze a code repository structure
      without performing a detailed review. This tool flattens the repository
      into a textual representation and is ideal for getting a high-level
      overview of code organization, directory structure, and file contents. Use
      it before code_review when you need to understand the codebase structure
      first, or when a full code review is not needed.

  - name: code_review
    description: Use this tool when you need a comprehensive code review with
      specific feedback on code quality, security issues, performance problems,
      and maintainability concerns. This tool performs in-depth analysis on a
      repository or specific files and returns structured results including
      issues found, their severity, recommendations for fixes, and overall
      strengths of the codebase. Use it when you need actionable insights to
      improve code quality or when evaluating a codebase for potential problems.
