  description: >-
    This project will install MCP - Model Context Protocol Server, that provides
    configured REST API's as context to LLM's.

    Using this we can enable LLMs to interact with RestAPI's and perform REST
    API call's using LLM prompts.

    Currently we support HTTP API Call's GET/PUT/POST/PATCH.
