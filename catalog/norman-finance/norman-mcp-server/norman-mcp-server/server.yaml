  description: >-
    Norman Finance is an accounting and tax filing autopilot designed for
    entrepreneurs in Germany. The Norman Finance MCP server enables new ways of
    interacting with Norman Finance's accounting, tax, and invoicing services.
    Simplifying financial workflows by integrating Norman Finance API
    capabilities directly into the LLM environment.


    It’s like having a personal accounting & tax manager — but built into
    Claude, Cursor, or any favorite LLMs


    See the README.md in the GitHub repo for manual installation instructions.
