          examples:
            - The Moon doesn't have a capital — it has no
              countries,                     governments, or permanent residents
            - Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models to
              make                     predictions or classifications.
              Unsupervised learning, on the other                     hand,
              works with unlabeled data to uncover hidden patterns
              or                     groupings, such as through clustering or
              dimensionality reduction.
            - Transformers are neural network architectures designed
              for                     sequence modeling tasks like NLP. They
              rely on self-attention                     mechanisms to weigh the
              importance of different input tokens,                     enabling
              parallel processing of input data. Unlike RNNs, they
              don't                     process sequentially, which allows for
              faster training and better                     handling of
              long-range dependencies.

            - >-
              Evaluate how well the response fulfills the requirements of the
              instruction by providing relevant information. This includes
              responding in accordance with the explicit and implicit purpose of
              given instruction.

                                      Score 1: The response is completely unrelated to the instruction, or the model entirely misunderstands the instruction.
                                      Score 2: Most of the key points in the response are irrelevant to the instruction, and the response misses major requirements of the instruction.
                                      Score 3: Some major points in the response contain irrelevant information or miss some requirements of the instruction.
                                      Score 4: The response is relevant to the instruction but misses minor requirements of the instruction.
                                      Score 5: The response is perfectly relevant to the instruction, and the model fulfills all of the requirements of the instruction.

                                      Your score should be an integer between 1 and 5.
            - >
              Evaluate whether the information provided in the response is
              correct given the reference response.
                                      Ignore differences in punctuation and phrasing between the response and reference response.
                                      It is okay if the response contains more information than the reference response, as long as it does not contain any conflicting statements.

                                      "No": The response is not factually accurate when compared against the reference response or includes conflicting statements.
                                      "Yes": The response is supported by the reference response and does not contain conflicting statements.

                                      Your score should be either "No" or "Yes".
