  - name: create_comment
    description: Creates a draft comment to respond to an existing Reddit post or
      comment. This tool should be used when you want to contribute to an
      ongoing discussion, provide feedback, or engage with other users' content.
      The comment should be relevant to the parent content, maintain appropriate

      include markdown formatting for better readability (e.g., lists, quotes,
      code blocks). This tool creates a draft that can be reviewed and edited
      before posting - it doesn't post automatically. Use this for thoughtful
      responses that add value to the discussion.

      another Reddit user. It's suitable for personal communications, inquiries,
      or follow-ups that shouldn't be public. The tool creates a draft that can
      be reviewed and edited before sending. Note that this only creates the
      message - it doesn't send it automatically. Messages should be concise,
      clear, and follow Reddit's guidelines for private communications.

  - name: create_post
    description: Creates a draft of a new text post for Reddit. This tool should be
      used when you want to start a new discussion, share information, or ask
      questions in a subreddit. It creates a draft that can be reviewed and
      edited before posting. The post should follow the target subreddit's rules
      and conventions, including proper formatting, flair usage if required, and
      appropriate content warnings (NSFW/spoiler tags). Consider the subreddit's
      culture and typical post structure when creating content. This tool is
      ideal for text-based submissions - use other tools for image, link, or
      video posts.

      reply. This tool should be used when content needs to be removed from
      Reddit, whether due to errors, inappropriate content, or user request.
      Note that deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Use this tool
      carefully as it permanently removes the content from Reddit's public view,
      though it may still be visible in some Reddit archives. This tool is
      particularly useful for removing mistakenly posted content or managing
      your Reddit presence.

      clarifications, updating outdated information, or expanding on points
      based on feedback. Note that Reddit shows an 'edited' indicator on
      modified content. While the edit history isn't public, it's good practice
      to maintain transparency about significant changes, perhaps with an
      'Edit:' note explaining the changes.
