    Talk to your Mixpanel analytics events data seamlessly! Query retention
    number, event data, funnels and more from any MCP client. Great for
    on-demand look ups like: "What's the weekly retention for users in the Feb 1
    cohort?"


    I am adding more coverage of the Mixpanel API over time, let me know which
    tools you need or just open a PR.


    Make sure you go to your Mixpanel Organization Settings and create a service
    account. Then get your project ID from your project settings.
