  - name: camera-tool
    description: >-
      This tool captures and returns a real-time snapshot from a designated
      security camera. The image reflects the current scene in the camera's
      field of view and serves as a contextual input source for downstream tasks
      such as object recognition, anomaly detection, incident investigation, or
      situational assessment. When invoked, the tool provides the following: 
       â€¢	Visual Scene Capture: A high-resolution image of what the camera is actively observing, including people, vehicles, license plates, and any detectable objects. 
      â€¢	Scene Context: Metadata such as camera ID, location name, timestamp, and
      motion detection status if available. 

      â€¢	Enriched Data Potential: The image can be paired with AI models or
      downstream analytics to extract insights such as: 

      â€¢	Number and type of objects in frame (e.g., humans, cars, packages) 

      â€¢	Unusual behaviors (e.g., loitering, unauthorized access) 

      â€¢	Environmental conditions (e.g., lighting, obstruction, cleanliness) 

      Use Cases: 

      â€¢	Verify what triggered a motion alert or analytic rule. 

      â€¢	Provide visual context for access events or alarms. 

      â€¢	Support live incident triage or retrospective investigations. 

      â€¢	Feed contextual imagery to agents making security or operational
      decisions. 

      Invocation Notes: 

      To use this tool correctly, the agent should provide the specific camera
      identifier or location name. If possible, include the intent (e.g.,
      "verify unauthorized access", "identify vehicle", "check for
      obstructions") to enhance downstream processing or summarization.
