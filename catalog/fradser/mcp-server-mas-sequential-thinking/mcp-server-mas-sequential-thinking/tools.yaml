      \    Processes one step in a sequential thinking chain using the Agno team
      in coordinate mode.


      \    The Coordinator agent within the team receives the thought, breaks it
      down,

      \    delegates to specialists (Planner, Researcher, Analyzer, Critic,
      Synthesizer),

      \    and synthesizes their outputs into a final response. The
      Coordinator's response

      \    may include suggestions for revision or branching.


      \    Parameters:

      \        thought (str): The current thinking step.

      \        thoughtNumber (int): Current sequence number (≥1)

      \        totalThoughts (int): Estimated total thoughts needed (≥5
      suggested)

      \        nextThoughtNeeded (bool): Whether another thought step is needed

      \        isRevision (bool, optional): Whether this revises previous
      thinking

      \        revisesThought (int, optional): Which thought is being
      reconsidered

      \        branchFromThought (int, optional): If branching, which thought
      number is the branch point

      \        branchId (str, optional): Branch identifier

      \        needsMoreThoughts (bool, optional): If more thoughts are needed
      beyond current estimate


      \    Returns:

      \        str: JSON string containing the Coordinator's synthesized
      response and status.
