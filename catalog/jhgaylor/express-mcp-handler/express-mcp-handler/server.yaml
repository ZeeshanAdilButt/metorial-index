  description: Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) seamlessly into your Express
    applications to handle both stateful and stateless MCP requests. Manage
    long-lived sessions with Server-Sent Events or handle isolated one-off
    requests with ease. Simplify MCP server implementation with flexible
    middleware that plugs directly into your Express routes.
