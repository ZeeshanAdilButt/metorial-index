  description: The DomainGenius MCP server is a powerful domain availability
    checking service that powers the domain search functionality of
    DomainGenius. This server provides real-time domain availability checks and
    pricing information through integration with Vercel's API. It features
    intelligent TLD handling (automatically defaulting to .com when no TLD is
    specified) and delivers comprehensive responses including domain
    availability status, registration pricing, and detailed error information.
    Built with TypeScript and following the ModelContextProtocol (MCP)
    specification, this server enables seamless integration with AI-powered
    domain search tools, making it an essential component of the DomainGenius
    platform's domain discovery capabilities.
