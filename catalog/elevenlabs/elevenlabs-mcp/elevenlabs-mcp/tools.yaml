    description: "Convert text to speech with a given voice and save the output
      audio file to a given directory.

      \    Directory is optional, if not provided, the output file will be saved
      to $HOME/Desktop.

      \    Only one of voice_id or voice_name can be provided. If none are
      provided, the default voice will be used.


      \    ⚠️ COST WARNING: This tool makes an API call to ElevenLabs which may
      incur costs. Only use when explicitly requested by the user.


      \     Args:

      \        text (str): The text to convert to speech.

      \        voice_name (str, optional): The name of the voice to use.

      \        stability (float, optional): Stability of the generated audio.
      Determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each
      generation. Lower values introduce broader emotional range for the voice.
      Higher values can result in a monotonous voice with limited emotion. Range
      is 0 to 1.

      \        similarity_boost (float, optional): Similarity boost of the
      generated audio. Determines how closely the AI should adhere to the
      original voice when attempting to replicate it. Range is 0 to 1.

      \        style (float, optional): Style of the generated audio. Determines
      the style exaggeration of the voice. This setting attempts to amplify the
      style of the original speaker. It does consume additional computational
      resources and might increase latency if set to anything other than 0.
      Range is 0 to 1.

      \        use_speaker_boost (bool, optional): Use speaker boost of the
      generated audio. This setting boosts the similarity to the original
      speaker. Using this setting requires a slightly higher computational load,
      which in turn increases latency.

      \        speed (float, optional): Speed of the generated audio. Controls
      the speed of the generated speech. Values range from 0.7 to 1.2, with 1.0
      being the default speed. Lower values create slower, more deliberate
      speech while higher values produce faster-paced speech. Extreme values can
      impact the quality of the generated speech. Range is 0.7 to 1.2.

      \        output_directory (str, optional): Directory where files should be
      saved.

      \            Defaults to $HOME/Desktop if not provided.


      \    Returns:

      \        Text content with the path to the output file and name of the
