    ## Overview


    MCP Think Tank provides **Cursor** and **Claude @Web** with a sophisticated
    environment for enhanced reasoning capabilities. It features advanced
    **Sequential Thinking & Chained Reasoning** processes, a robust **Knowledge
    Graph Memory** system with versioning, and intelligent **Tool Orchestration
    with Call-Limit Safeguards**.


    This platform enables AI assistants to approach complex problems through
    structured multi-step reasoning, maintain persistent knowledge across
    conversations, and utilize web research and task management capabilities—all
    while ensuring responsible and efficient tool usage through built-in
    safeguards.


    ## 🎯 Philosophy


    MCP Think Tank is built on three core principles:


    1. **Elegant Simplicity**: Minimal, well-designed tools that work with
    Claude's natural capabilities rather than trying to replicate or override
    them.


    2. **Enhanced Reflection**: Gentle guidance rather than rigid structure,
    enabling better reasoning and self-reflection without constraining Claude's
    thinking process.


    3. **Persistent Context**: Knowledge graph provides memory across
    conversations while maintaining simplicity in both storage and retrieval.

    ## 🧠 Using MCP Think Tank


    ### Tools Overview


    #### 1. Think Tool (Structured Reasoning)


    Use `think` for complex decisions, architecture planning, and
    problem-solving with:

    - Clear step-by-step reasoning

    - Self-reflection capabilities

    - Persistent memory storage

    - Research integration


    ```javascript

    // Complex architecture decision with memory storage

    mcp_think-tool_think({
      structuredReasoning: "Analyzing database options for our user management system...",
      category: "architecture",
      storeInMemory: true
    })

    ```


    #### 2. Memory & Knowledge Graph


    Store and retrieve important information across conversations:


    | Tool | When to Use |

    |------|-------------|

    | `upsert_entities` | Document important concepts or update existing
    entities |

    | `add_observations` | Add new facts to existing entities |

    | `create_relations` | Connect related concepts |

    | `search_nodes` | Find relevant knowledge |

    | `open_nodes` | Retrieve specific entity details |


    #### 3. Task Management


    Manage project workflows with:

    - `plan_tasks`: Create multiple tasks at once

    - `list_tasks`: See current work status

    - `next_task`: Get highest priority task

    - `complete_task`: Mark tasks as finished

    - `update_tasks`: Change task priorities or details


    #### 4. Web Research (Exa)


    Access current information when needed:

    - `exa_search`: Find web information with customizable parameters

    - `exa_answer`: Get factual answers with cited sources


    ### How To Save Important Thoughts


    When using the `think` tool for important reasoning:


    1. **Simple Storage**: Tell the agent "Please save this reasoning in memory
    for future reference" to automatically save with `storeInMemory: true`


    2. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Break down complex problems into logical steps
    with progress tracking
       ```javascript
       // Example parameters
       plannedSteps: 5,  // Total steps planned
       currentStep: 2    // Current step number
       ```

    3. **Self-Reflection**: Request reflection by saying "Please analyze this
    reasoning and provide a reflection on potential improvements"
       ```javascript
       // Enabled with 
       selfReflect: true,
       reflectPrompt: "Custom reflection instructions" // Optional
       ```

    4. **Research Integration**: Include research queries directly in reasoning
       ```javascript
       // Enable with
       allowResearch: true
       
       // Then use syntax:
       "I need to understand [research: your search query] before continuing..."
       ```

    ## ⚡ Performance Optimization


    MCP Think Tank includes built-in performance optimizations:


    ### Content Caching

    - Automatic caching of file and URL content based on cryptographic hashing

    - Prevents redundant file reads and network requests

    - In tests, cached URL fetches were over 1000× faster than the initial fetch

    - File reads showed significant improvements with 2-5× speedup on subsequent
    reads

    - Cache size and TTL are configurable via environment variables


    ### Tool Call Optimization

    - Identical tool calls are automatically cached to prevent counting
    duplicates against your limit

    - Intelligent error handling, especially for Exa search, prevents failures
    from non-JSON responses

    - Tool limit safeguards prevent runaway tool usage while providing graceful
    degradation


    ## 🛡️ Tool Orchestration & Safeguards


    MCP Think Tank v2.0.2 includes comprehensive tool management features to
    ensure responsible and efficient usage:


    ### Usage Limits & Monitoring

    - **Default limit**: 25 tool calls per session (configurable via
    `TOOL_LIMIT` environment variable)

    - **Automatic tracking**: All tool calls are logged with timestamps, agent
    IDs, and parameters

    - **Graceful degradation**: When limits are reached, the system returns
    partial results rather than failing completely

    - **Status tracking**: Tool calls that exceed limits are tagged with
    `HALTED_LIMIT` status


    ### Intelligent Caching

    - **Duplicate detection**: Identical tool calls are automatically detected
    and served from cache

    - **Content hashing**: File and URL operations use SHA-1 hashing to identify
    unchanged content

    - **Configurable caching**: Enable/disable caching behavior through
    environment variables

    - **Cache statistics**: Monitor cache hit/miss rates for performance
    analysis


    ### Tool Access Control

    - **Configurable whitelists**: Restrict which tools can be used in specific
    contexts

    - **Permission errors**: Clear error messages when disallowed tools are
    requested

    - **Orchestration strategies**: Multiple coordination strategies for
    sequential or parallel execution

    - **Agent isolation**: Tool usage tracked per agent to prevent
    cross-contamination


    ### Implementation

    The safeguards are implemented through a dedicated `ToolManager` that wraps
    all tool calls:

    - Atomic counters ensure accurate tracking even in concurrent environments

    - LRU cache prevents redundant operations while maintaining memory
    efficiency

    - Comprehensive error handling provides meaningful feedback rather than
    cryptic failures

    - All limits and caching behavior are configurable without code changes


    > 🔒 **Security note:**

    > The tool orchestration system ensures that even if a prompt attempts to
    force excessive tool usage, it will be gracefully limited according to your
    configuration.

    **Best Practices for Cursor/Claude and Large Projects:**

    - Use the `think` tool liberally for all non-trivial reasoning and always
    persist important thoughts.

    - Integrate research and task management into your coding workflow for
    seamless project development.

    - Regularly review and update your knowledge graph to keep project memory
    relevant and actionable.

    - Reference and build upon previous decisions and patterns for consistent,
    high-quality code.

    - Be mindful of tool limits in complex workflows, and use the cache stats
    utilities to monitor usage.
