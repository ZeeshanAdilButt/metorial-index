  - name: generate_diagram_url
    description: Generate a URL for a diagram using Kroki.io. This tool takes
      Mermaid diagram code or other supported diagram formats and returns a URL
      to the rendered diagram. The URL can be used to display the diagram in web
      browsers or embedded in documents.

        - content
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          description: Diagram type (e.g., "mermaid" for Mermaid diagrams, "plantuml" for
            PlantUML, "graphviz" for GraphViz DOT, "c4plantuml" for C4
            architecture diagrams, and many more). See Kroki.io documentation
            for all supported formats.
        content:
          type: string
          description: The diagram content in the specified format. For Mermaid diagrams,
            this would be the Mermaid syntax code (e.g., "graph TD; A-->B;
            B-->C;").
        outputFormat:
          type: string
          description: 'The format of the output image. Options are: "svg" (vector
            graphics, default), "png" (raster image), "pdf" (document format),
            "jpeg" (compressed raster image), or "base64" (base64-encoded SVG
            for direct embedding in HTML).'
  - name: download_diagram
    description: Download a diagram image to a local file. This tool converts
      diagram code (such as Mermaid) into an image file and saves it to the
      specified location on your filesystem. Useful for generating diagrams for
      presentations, documentation, or other offline use.
    inputSchema:
      type: object
      required:
        - type
        - content
        - outputPath
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          description: Diagram type (e.g., "mermaid" for Mermaid diagrams, "plantuml" for
            PlantUML, "graphviz" for GraphViz DOT). Supports the same diagram
            types as Kroki.io, including mermaid, plantuml, graphviz,
            c4plantuml, excalidraw, and many others.
        content:
          type: string
          description: The diagram content in the specified format. This is the actual
            diagram code that will be converted to an image (e.g., the Mermaid
            syntax for a flowchart or sequence diagram).
        outputPath:
          type: string
          description: The complete file path where the diagram image should be saved,
            including the filename and extension (e.g.,
            "/Users/username/Documents/diagram.svg"). The directory must exist
            or be creatable by the system.
        outputFormat:
          type: string
          description: 'The format of the output image. If not specified, the format will
            be determined from the file extension of the outputPath. Options
            are: "svg" (vector graphics, best for web and scaling), "png"
            (raster image, good for presentations), "pdf" (document format, good
            for printing), or "jpeg" (compressed raster image).'
