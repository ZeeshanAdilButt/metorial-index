    Think Tool - A local-first MCP server that provides AI assistants with a
    dedicated "thinking space" to reason through complex problems step-by-step. 


    Includes built-in template prompts for various thinking frameworks, enabling
    structured reasoning, policy verification, and custom domain-specific
    thinking patterns. Unlike the other thinking tools, this has a few main
    advantages:

    1. conserves prompt tokens (the other tools are doubling your context tokens
    for no reason).

    2. prompt templates for thinking step examples

    3. local only! You don't need to send a request to a server for this tool. 


    Built with Deno and FastMCP to enhance AI reasoning capabilities while
    running entirely on your local machine.
