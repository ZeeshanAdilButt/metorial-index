      List available Confluence spaces with filtering options and pagination
      support.

              PURPOSE: Discovers accessible Confluence spaces, providing metadata about each space including ID, key, name, description, and status. This tool is essential for finding spaces before working with their content.

              WHEN TO USE:
              - When you need to discover what spaces exist in the Confluence instance.
              - When you need to find a space's ID or key to use with other tools.
              - When you need to filter spaces by type ('global', 'personal', 'archived').
              - When you need to locate a space by partial name matching.
              - When you need to browse available content sources.
              - As a first step before using 'list_pages' or content search tools.

              WHEN NOT TO USE:
              - When you already know the specific space ID/key (use 'get_space' instead).
              - When you need to search for page content (use 'search' instead).
              - When you need to list pages within a known space (use 'list_pages' instead).
              - When you need detailed information about a specific space (use 'get_space' instead).

              RETURNS: Formatted list of spaces including:
              - Numeric ID (used for most API operations)
              - Space key (short identifier, e.g., 'DEV', 'HR', etc.)
              - Display name and description
              - Type (global, personal) and status (current, archived)
              - Creation information and URL
              
              Results can be paginated using the 'limit' and 'cursor' parameters.
              
              SORTING: By default, spaces are sorted by name in descending order.

              EXAMPLES:
              - List all spaces: {}
              - Filter by type: { type: ["global"] }
              - Filter by status: { status: ["current"] }
              - Search by name: { query: "Engineering" }
              - With pagination: { limit: 20, cursor: "some-cursor-value" }

              ERRORS:
              - Authentication failures: Check Confluence credentials.
              - Permission issues: Ensure you have access to view spaces.
              - Invalid filter values: Verify type/status values match allowed options.
              - No spaces found: May indicate permission issues or overly restrictive filters.

    description: >-
      Retrieve comprehensive details about a specific Confluence space by ID.

              PURPOSE: Fetches complete metadata and configuration information for a space, identified by its numeric ID. Provides all available details about a space, including permissions, themes, and homepage.

              WHEN TO USE:
              - When you need detailed information about a specific space's configuration.
              - When you need the numeric ID of a space's homepage to use with 'get_page'.
              - When you need to verify permissions, status, or theme settings.
              - When you need to analyze space metadata before working with its content.
              - After finding a space through 'list_spaces' and needing more details.
              - When you need to determine if a space is active, archived, or has specific restrictions.

              WHEN NOT TO USE:

              - When you need to list pages in a space (use 'list_pages' instead).
              - When you need to search for content (use 'search' instead).
              - When you only have a space key and need the ID (use 'list_spaces' first).

              RETURNS: Comprehensive space details formatted in Markdown, including:
              - Full name, key, and ID information
              - Description and homepage details
              - Type, status, and theme configuration

              - Creation and modification metadata
              - URLs for accessing the space directly
              
              All available metadata is fetched by default to provide complete information.

              EXAMPLES:
              - Get space with ID 123456: { spaceId: "123456" }

              ERRORS:
              - Space not found (404): Verify the numeric space ID exists and is accessible.
              - Permission denied (403): Check if you have access to the space.
              - Authentication failure: Verify Confluence credentials.

  - name: list_pages
    description: >-
      List Confluence pages, optionally filtering by space ID(s), status, or
      title/content/label query, with pagination.

              PURPOSE: Discover pages within specific spaces or across the instance based on status or simple text matching. Provides page metadata and IDs needed for the 'get_page' tool.

              WHEN TO USE:
              - To list pages within one or more specific spaces (using 'spaceId').
              - To find pages based on their status ('current', 'archived', etc.).
              - To perform simple text searches on page titles or labels ('query').
              - To get an overview of recent pages in a space before getting full content.
              - To obtain 'pageId' values for use with 'get_page'.

              WHEN NOT TO USE:
              - When you need to search the *full content* of pages with complex logic (use 'search' with CQL).
              - When you already know the 'pageId' and need details (use 'get_page').
              - When you need space information (use space tools).
              - If you only have the space *key* (use 'list-spaces' or 'get-space' to find the numeric 'spaceId' first).

              RETURNS: Formatted list of pages including ID, title, space ID, status, author, creation date, version, and URL. Includes pagination details if applicable (Confluence uses cursor-based pagination).
              
              SORTING: By default, pages are sorted by modified date in descending order (most recently modified first). You can change this by specifying a different value in the 'sort' parameter (e.g., "title" for alphabetical sorting).

              EXAMPLES:
              - List pages in space 123456: { spaceId: ["123456"] }
              - List archived pages in space 123456: { spaceId: ["123456"], status: ["archived"] }
              - Find pages with "Project Plan" in title/label in space 123456: { spaceId: ["123456"], query: "Project Plan" }
              - Paginate results: { limit: 10, cursor: "some-cursor-value" }
              - Sort pages by title: { spaceId: ["123456"], sort: "title" }

              ERRORS:
              - Space ID not found: Verify the numeric 'spaceId' is correct.
              - Invalid status: Ensure 'status' is one of the allowed values.
              - Authentication failures: Check Confluence credentials.
              - No pages found: Filters might be too restrictive, or the space is empty/inaccessible.

              PURPOSE: Performs advanced content searches across Confluence using CQL queries, allowing for complex search patterns, content filtering, and targeted results. This is the most powerful search tool for Confluence, supporting complex filtering and sorting.

              WHEN TO USE:
              - When you need to search for specific text or patterns within page content (not just titles).
              - When you need to combine multiple search criteria (e.g., text + space + date + type).
              - When you need to search using complex logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
              - When simple title/label searches via 'list_pages' are insufficient.
              - When you need to search across all content types (pages, blog posts, attachments, etc.).
              - When you need fine-grained sorting control over search results.

              WHEN NOT TO USE:

              - When you only need to list pages in a space by title (use 'list_pages' with optional query).
              - When you need to explore or browse spaces (use space-related tools).
              - When you're not searching for actual content (e.g., for space metadata).

              RETURNS: Formatted search results including:
              - Result type (page, blog, attachment, etc.)
              - Title and content excerpt with highlighted match terms
              - Space information, creation metadata, and URL
              - Content ID for use with other tools like 'get_page'
              
              Results can be paginated using the 'limit' and 'cursor' parameters.

              CQL EXAMPLES:
              - Basic text search: { cql: "text ~ 'project plan'" }
              - Combined criteria: { cql: "text ~ 'quarterly report' AND space = DEV AND type = 'page'" }
