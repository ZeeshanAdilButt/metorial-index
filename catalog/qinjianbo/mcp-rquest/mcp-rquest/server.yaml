  name: HTTP Request Server with Browser Emulation
  description: Provide advanced HTTP request capabilities with realistic browser
    emulation to enable LLMs like Claude to interact naturally with websites and
    bypass anti-bot measures. Convert HTML and PDF documents to Markdown for
    easier processing by language models. Support a wide range of HTTP methods,
    authentication schemes, and secure TLS fingerprints for authentic browser
    traffic simulation.
