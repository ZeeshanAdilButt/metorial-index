    CodingBaby Browser-Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a tool that bridges
    an AI assistant with the Chrome browser, enabling the AI assistant to
    directly control Chrome for web browsing, interaction, and data collection.
    It communicates with a Chrome extension via the WebSocket protocol to
    achieve precise browser control.


    Compared to traditional browser automation tools like Puppeteer or
    Playwright, CodingBaby Browser-Use MCP offers several advantages:


    1. Higher Privileges: Running as a Chrome extension provides higher browser
    privileges.

    2. Anti-Bot Evasion: Uses a real Chrome browser and user session,
    effectively bypassing many website anti-bot mechanisms.

    3. Closer to Real User Behavior: Operations mimic real user interactions,
    reducing the likelihood of detection.

    4. Session Persistence: Can maintain login states and cookies, facilitating
    access to authenticated pages.

    5. Lightweight Deployment: Only requires installing the extension in the
    browser, eliminating the need for separate browser instances or WebDrivers.
