      Execute code or a command on a Heroku one-off dyno in a sandboxed
      environment with network and filesystem access.


      **Requirements:**

      - Display command output to the user.

      - Determine app language using the 'app_info' tool to identify the Heroku
      buildpack.

      - Use shell commands for environment setup (e.g., package installations)
      before execution.

      - Output must utilize standard input/output.


      **Capabilities:**

      - Network and filesystem access

      - Environment variables support

      - File creation and execution in supported languages

      - Temporary directory management


      **Guidelines:**

      1. Use the appropriate Heroku-supported language runtime.

      2. Ensure correct syntax and module imports for the chosen language.

      3. Organize code into classes/functions, executed from the top level.

      4. For external packages:
         - Specify in the appropriate package manager file.
         - Minimize dependencies.
         - Prefer native modules when possible.

      **Example (Node.js package manager file):**

      ```json

      {
        "type": "module",
        "dependencies": {
          "axios": "^1.6.0"
        }
      }

      ```
