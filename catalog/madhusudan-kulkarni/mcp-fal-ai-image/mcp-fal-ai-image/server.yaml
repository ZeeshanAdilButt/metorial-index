    MCP fal.ai Image Server


    Effortlessly generate images from text prompts using fal.ai and the Model
    Context Protocol (MCP). Integrates directly with AI IDEs like Cursor and
    Windsurf.


    ## When and Why to Use


    This tool is designed for:

    - Developers and designers who want to generate images from text prompts
    without leaving their IDE.

    - Rapid prototyping of UI concepts, marketing assets, or creative ideas.

    - Content creators needing unique visuals for blogs, presentations, or
    social media.

    - AI researchers and tinkerers experimenting with the latest fal.ai models.

    - Automating workflows that require programmatic image generation via MCP.


    Key features:

    - Supports any valid fal.ai model and all major image parameters.

    - Works out of the box with Node.js and a fal.ai API key.

    - Saves images locally with accessible file paths.

    - Simple configuration and robust error handling.


    ## Quick Start


    1. Requirements: Node.js 18+, fal.ai API key

    2. Configure MCP:
       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "fal-ai-image": {
             "command": "npx",
             "args": ["-y", "mcp-fal-ai-image"],
             "env": { "FAL_KEY": "YOUR-FAL-AI-API-KEY" }
           }
         }
       }
    3. Run: Use the generate-image tool from your IDE.


    üí° Typical Workflow:

    Describe the image you want (e.g., ‚Äúgenerate a landscape with flying cars
    using model fal-ai/kolors, 2 images, landscape_16_9‚Äù) and get instant
    results in your IDE.


    ### üó®Ô∏è Example Prompts


    - generate an image of a red apple

    - generate an image of a red apple using model fal-ai/kolors

    - generate 3 images of a glowing red apple in a futuristic city using model
    fal-ai/recraft-v3, square_hd, 40 inference steps, guidance scale 4.0, safety
    checker on


    Supported parameters: prompt, model ID (any fal.ai model), number of images,
    image size, inference steps, guidance scale, safety checker.


    Images are saved locally; file paths are shown in the response. For model
    IDs, see fal.ai/models.


    ## Troubleshooting


    - FAL_KEY environment variable is not set: Set your fal.ai API key as above.

    - npx not found: Install Node.js 18+ and npm.


    Advanced: Example MCP Request/Response


    Request:

    {
      "tool": "generate-image",
      "args": {
        "prompt": "A futuristic cityscape at sunset",
        "model": "fal-ai/kolors"
      }
    }


    Example response:

    {
      "images": [
        { "url": "file:///path/to/generated_image1.png" },
        { "url": "file:///path/to/generated_image2.png" }
      ]
    }


    ## üìÅ Image Output Directory


    Generated images are saved to your local system:


    - By default: ~/Downloads/fal_ai (on Linux/macOS; uses XDG standard if
    available)

    - Custom location: Set the environment variable FAL_IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR to
    your desired folder. Images will be saved in /fal_ai.


    The full file path for each image is included in the tool's response.


    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling & Troubleshooting


    - If you specify a model ID that is not supported by fal.ai, you will
    receive an error from the backend. Double-check for typos or visit
    fal.ai/models to confirm the model ID.

    - For the latest list of models and their capabilities, refer to the fal.ai
    model catalog or API docs.

    - For other errors, consult your MCP client logs or open an issue on GitHub.


    ## ü§ù Contributing


    Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open issues or pull
    requests on GitHub.


    ## üîí Security


    - Your API key is only used locally to authenticate with fal.ai.

    - No user data is stored or transmitted except as required by fal.ai API.
