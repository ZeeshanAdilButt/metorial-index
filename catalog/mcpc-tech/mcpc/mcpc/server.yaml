  description: >-
    Run JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python code snippets securely in a sandboxed
    environment with support for **dynamic package imports**. Enable AI agents
    and workflows to execute and verify code logic safely and conveniently.
    Benefit from multi-language support and strict permission controls to
    prevent malicious code execution.


    **Core Capabilities:**

    - **Import Any Package:** Dynamically import and use external libraries in
    your code (specific support depends on the chosen runtime).

    - **Secure Sandbox:** Code runs in an isolated environment with strict
    limitations on file system, network, and environment variable access,
    preventing malicious code from affecting the host environment.

    - **Multi-language Support:** Execute JavaScript/TypeScript and Python code
    snippets with ease!
