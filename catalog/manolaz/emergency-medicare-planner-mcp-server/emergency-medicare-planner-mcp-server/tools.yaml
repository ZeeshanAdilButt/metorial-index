      A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective medical problem-solving through
      thoughts.

      This tool helps analyze medical problems through a flexible thinking
      process that can adapt and evolve.

      Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as
      understanding of the medical situation deepens.


      When to use this tool:

      - Breaking down complex medical problems into steps

      - Planning and designing treatment approaches with room for revision

      - Clinical analysis that might need course correction

      - Medical problems where the full scope might not be clear initially

      - Healthcare decisions that require a multi-step solution

      - Medical evaluations that need to maintain context over multiple steps

      - Situations where irrelevant medical information needs to be filtered out


      Key features:

      - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as the diagnosis progresses

      - You can question or revise previous medical assessments

      - You can add more diagnostic thoughts as new information emerges

      - You can express clinical uncertainty and explore alternative approaches

      - Not every medical assessment needs to build linearly - you can branch or
      backtrack

      - Generates a clinical hypothesis

      - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps

      - Repeats the process until a satisfactory diagnosis or treatment plan is
      reached

      - Provides a correct medical assessment or recommendation
