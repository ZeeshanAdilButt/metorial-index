  description: "Provide dynamic access to a wide range of functions (tools)
    managed by ACI.dev through two MCP server types: one for direct app-specific
    tool access and another for unified dynamic discovery and execution of all
    available tools. Simplify integration with LLM clients by enabling efficient
    tool calling without overloading the model's context window. Enhance your
    agents with seamless, scalable function calling capabilities across multiple
    apps."
