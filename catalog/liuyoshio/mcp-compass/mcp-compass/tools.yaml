      \          Use this tool when there is a need to findn external MCP tools.

      \          It explores and recommends existing MCP servers from the\ 

      \          internet, based on the description of the MCP Server\ 

      \          needed. It returns a list of MCP servers with their IDs,\ 

      \          descriptions, GitHub URLs, and similarity scores.

            \                Description for the MCP Server needed.\ 

            \                It should be specific and actionable, e.g.:

            \                GOOD:

            \                - 'MCP Server for AWS Lambda Python3.9 deployment'

            \                - 'MCP Server for United Airlines booking API'

            \                - 'MCP Server for Stripe refund webhook handling'


            \                BAD:

            \                - 'MCP Server for cloud' (too vague)

            \                - 'MCP Server for booking' (which booking system?)

            \                - 'MCP Server for payment' (which payment
            provider?)


            \                Query should explicitly specify:

            \                1. Target platform/vendor (e.g. AWS, Stripe,
            MongoDB)

            \                2. Exact operation/service (e.g. Lambda deployment,
            webhook handling)

            \                3. Additional context if applicable (e.g. Python,
            refund events)

            \                "
