  description: Enable language models to perform complex visual and spatial
    reasoning by creating, manipulating, and iterating on diagrammatic
    representations such as graphs, flowcharts, and concept maps. Enhance
    problem-solving capabilities by integrating visual thinking with verbal
    insights, supporting multi-modal outputs including ASCII art and SVG.
    Facilitate iterative refinement and pattern recognition through a flexible
    visual element manipulation system.
