  description: Enable models to perform structured analogical thinking by
    explicitly mapping and evaluating relationships between source and target
    domains. Enhance problem-solving, explanation, and creative ideation through
    systematic analogy construction, inference generation, and evaluation.
    Visualize analogical mappings to improve understanding and transfer of
    knowledge across domains.
