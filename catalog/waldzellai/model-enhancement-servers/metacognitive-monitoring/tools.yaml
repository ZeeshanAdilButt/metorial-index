    description: >-
      A detailed tool for systematic self-monitoring of knowledge and reasoning
      quality.

      This tool helps models track knowledge boundaries, claim certainty, and
      reasoning biases.

      It provides a framework for metacognitive assessment across various
      domains and reasoning tasks.


      When to use this tool:

      - Uncertain domains requiring calibrated confidence

      - Complex reasoning chains with potential biases

      - Technical domains with clear knowledge boundaries

      - Scenarios requiring distinction between facts, inferences, and
      speculation

      - Claims requiring clear evidential basis


      Key features:

      - Knowledge boundary tracking

      - Claim classification and confidence calibration

      - Reasoning quality monitoring

      - Bias and assumption detection

      - Uncertainty area identification
