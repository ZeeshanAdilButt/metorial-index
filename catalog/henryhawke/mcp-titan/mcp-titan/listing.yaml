description: A memory engine designed for LLMs, enabling continuous learning and
  context management through a transformer-based neural memory system that can
  predict sequences and maintain state across interactions.
skills:
  - Maintain memory state across interactions
  - Learn and predict sequences
  - Perform efficient tensor operations
  - Integrate seamlessly with LLMs like Claude 3.7 Sonnet
