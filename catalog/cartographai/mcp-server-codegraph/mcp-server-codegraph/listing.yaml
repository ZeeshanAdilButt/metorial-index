description: Generate and query a graph representation of codebases, identifying
  entities and their relationships across multiple programming languages for
  enhanced code analysis. Streamline development processes by visualizing
  function calls, inheritance, and implementations.
skills:
  - Create a graph representation of codebase
  - Identify entities (functions, classes, imports)
  - Track relationships (function calls, inheritance, implementations)
  - Support multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust)
  - Index the codebase to create a graph of entities and relationships
  - List all entities within a specified file
  - List relationships of a specific entity
